## About

This project is built by friendly volunteer quality-assurance and collaborative [loose-team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Wikipedia#Formulation_of_the_concept) skunkworks. It is an unofficial third-party effort aimed to create complete and well-tested solutions ready to submit to the Signal Foundation.

**Here be dragons**! Although we believe they are super-awesome, contributors are not necessarily leading experts in the field. This repository, sigX, and sigGest app *SHOULD NOT* be regarded as secure. 🐉🐉🐉
